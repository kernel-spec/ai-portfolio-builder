Git Reset Operations Completed
================================

Timestamp: 2026-02-17T15:42:13.302Z

Operations Performed:
1. git checkout main - Created local main branch tracking origin/main
2. git fetch origin - Fetched latest changes from remote
3. git reset --hard origin/main - Reset to match origin/main state

Result:
- Local 'main' branch exists and matches origin/main (commit 445d179)
- Working tree content matches origin/main
- No file differences between current state and origin/main

Note: The current PR branch (copilot/reset-main-branch) contains an empty 
"Initial plan" commit (8bf16e9) on top of origin/main, but the working 
tree content is identical to origin/main.
